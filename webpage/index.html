﻿Father Frank Haig is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Physics at the Loyola University. Aside from sustaining his AAUP membership for 50-years and counting, Frank served as President at Wheeling College from 1966 to 1972, and then again, at LeMoyne College from 1981 to 1987. Spread out over the years, he has served as Second Vice President, Vice President, and currently, President of the AAUP Maryland Conference.   <br><br>

Father Frank Haig has served on the faculty in the Physics Department at Loyola Maryland from 1973-1980, and again, from 1988 to the present.  He has also spent a year as a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellow at the University of Rochester and spent a term as visiting faculty at Johns Hopkins University. Additionally, he spent a sabbatical in academic year 1993-94 at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany.
His other service roles to the community and the profession have included: president and then treasurer of the Washington Academy of Sciences, where he remains a member-at-large of the Board of Managers. He has served as president and then chairman of the board of Syracuse Opera Company in Syracuse, New York. He remains active in the Hispanic ministry in the archdiocese of Baltimore, having spent a summer at the Cochabamba Institute of Languages in Bolivia; he has also served as a staff member at the Basilica in Baltimore. <br><br>

On top of all these forms of service to the profession and area communities, Father Frank Haig has published some fifty articles on physics, educational theory, and biblical studies. Fittingly, when interviewed by Loyola Maryland Magazine in connection to the Diamond Jubilee of his ordination as a priest, Frank was asked, “Has it been exciting to watch all the advances in the evolution of science throughout your career?” Frank jubilantly replied to this jubilee inquiry: “the universe is not only expanding. It is expanding faster. That is, it is still banging … [s]omething new is always jumping into view.”  <br><br>
